Step 1 : Declare Maximum , Minimum as Variables
Step 2 : Ask User to enter number1
Step 3 : Ask user to enter number2
Step 4 : Use Conditional statment IF to check if number1 > number2
Step 5 : if number1 > number2 , set maximum to number1 (maximum = number1) and set minimum to number2 (minimum = number2)
Step 6 : Otherwise , Set  maximum to number2 and set minimum to number 1 
Step 7 : Remainder = Maximum % Minimum . Calculate Remainder
Step 8 :  Set Maximum = Minimum
          Set  Minimum = remainder
Step 9 : Repeat this process using while loop until minimum != 0
Step 10 : Print "GCD is Maximum" once the condition is satisfied.
