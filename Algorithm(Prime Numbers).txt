Step 1 : Declare ' I ' as variable indicating the divisors
Step 2 : Declare ' N ' as variable indicating the number value 
Step 3 : Ask the user to input a number as ' N ' (N = User Input)
Step 4 : Set  a variable indicating divisors ' I ' as 2 (I =2) 
Step 5 : Iterate through possible divisors using a while loop from 2 to n-1 . 
Step 6 : Remainder = N % I
Step 7 : Calculate the remainder of each divisor iterated.
Step 8 : Use conditional statement if to check if the remainder is 0 .
Step 9 : If remainder of number(n) with corresponding divisor(i)  is 0 .  Display " Number is non prime" and end the program , otherwise proceed to step 8 
Step 10 : If remainder of number (n) with corresponding divisor (i) is not 0 , Display "Number is prime"
