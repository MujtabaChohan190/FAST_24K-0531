Step 1 : Ask the user to input a number as 'n'
Step 2 : Set  a variable indicating divisors as 2 (i=2) 
Step 3 : Iterate through possible divisors using a loop from 2 to n-1 . ( i <- (n-1 ))
Step 4 : Remainder = number % n 
Step 5 : Calculate the remainder of each divisor iterated (n%i=0)
Step 6 : Use conditional statement if to check if the remainder is 0 .
Step 7 : If remainder of number(n) with corresponding divisor(i)  is 0 , Display " Number is non prime" and end the program.
Step 8 : If remainder is number (n) with corresponding divisor (i) is not 0 , Display "Number is prime"
