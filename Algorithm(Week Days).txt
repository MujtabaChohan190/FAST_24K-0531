Step 1 : Ask the user to enter Day Number 
Step 2 : Remainder = Day Number MOD 7
Step 3 : Calculate Remainder 
Step 4 : Use conditional statement to compare the remainder with the defined values.
        Remainder = 0 - Sunday
        Remainder = 1 - Monday
        Remainder = 2 - Tuesday
        Remainder = 3 - Wednesday
        Remainder = 4 - Thursday
        Remainder = 5 - Friday
        Remainder = 6 - Saturday
Step 5 : Output the corresponding Week Day according to Remainder
